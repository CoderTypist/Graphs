# comparisonFiles


DESCRIPTION


Each Linked List must be given a function to compare values. That means that the user must write a function to compare the data type being stored in the list. I decided to create the functions to compare basic data types. Writing them all on my own would have taken a while, so I wrote a bash script that wrote the code for me.


USAGE


./generateComparisons < typeList.txt
